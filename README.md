# Game-of-life
A simple java console aplication made to simulate conway's game of life
This project was made during the winter vacation(august) of 2018 as a simple programming exercise

-Instructions-
The program will first read the "jogo.txt" as a 'seed' in order to iniciate the simulation, so it's necessary to fill the file first.
To play it just the execute the "Executar.bat" file and input the number of desired 'generations' in the command promt. It is 
recommended to maximize the promt for the graphics(or ASCII art, call it what you wish) to generate properly.
